This is the first one I wasn't able to do part 2 with my goal of < 5 minutes,
< 5 new lines of code.  I did brute force for part 1

## 07

First one wasn't too hard.  Realized the median would be the middle of all
distances total.

Part 2 is the first one I didn't get right on the first submission.  I was
thinking that since the median discounts outliers, and average includes it, that
it would be a good approach to try for the second problem where costs increase.
Didn't work, but it felt like it might be an off by 1 error or a rounding error.

I tested a -1, +1, and a few beyond in each direction, and -1 provided the
lowest cost, so I submitted that and it worked.  Not satisfied with this
solution though.

## 08
Not very hard, but so very messy.  Still, I like problems with very ugly
solutions, although this one could use a lot of cleaning up.

I feel like there is a more elegant solution using a graph, similar to word
ladder, but I couldn't find it.

## 09
Finally a graph problem!  First part was straightforward.  Correct first sub,
much cleaner code than last time.

Second part more or less straightforward as well.  Wrong first submission
though...because I'm a dunce and didn't retest after I moved the last few lines
into a function, and I dropped sorting the array of basin sizes in doing so.

# 10
Balanced brackets!

Had a gauntlet thrown down.  Part 1 in 5 to 10 minutes or so!

Part 2 took a bit longer.  Was rushing to compete with a friend and of course
had lots of typos, etc.  Initially thought that my solution was wrong, then
I realized I didn't count the score from the right direction.
